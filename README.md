# my-first-web-project-for-github

My first GitHub project(mini card about me) — beginner web developer learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

Just a simple visual card — no fancy data, no frills. It’s my personal sandbox to explore HTML & CSS basics. Clean design, light 
touch, and a tiny step into the world of frontend. Sometimes small things say a lot.
